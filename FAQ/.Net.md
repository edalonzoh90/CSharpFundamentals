1. Differences between ASP.NET Core over the classic ASP.NET?  
- Cross-Platform  
- High Performance  
- Open Source  

2. What is the MVC pattern?
It's an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components:  
- Model: Only hold the data and the business logic. They don't deal with HTTP requests.
- View: Views only display information.   
- Controller: Handle and respond to user input and decide which model to pass to which view. 

3. Purpose of .csproj file?
- It tells .NET how to build the project.
- Lists all their dependencies
- Is used by the nugger to figure out which packages to download and copy to the project
- Contains all the information that .NET tooling needs to build the project. It includes the type of project you are building, the platform this project targets, and any dependencies on other projects or 3rd party libraries.

4. What is CoreCLR?
It's the run-time execution engine provided by the .NET Core. It consists of a JIT compiler, garbage collector, low-level classes, and primitive data types.

5. What is the purpose of webHostBuilder()?
WebHostBuilder function is used for HTTP pipeline creation through webHostBuilder.Use() chaining all at once with WebHostBuilder.Build() by using the builder pattern. This function is provided by Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting namespace. The Build() method’s purpose is building necessary services and a Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IWebHost for hosting a web application.

6. What is Zero Garbage Collectors?
Zero Garbage Collectors allows you for object allocation as this is required by the Execution Engine. Created objects will not get deleted automatically and theoretically, no longer required memory is never reclaimed.  

7. What is CoreFx?
CoreFX is the set of class library implementations for .NET Core. It includes collection types, console, file systems, XML, JSON, async, etc. It is platform-neutral code, which means it can be shared across all platforms. Platform-neutral code is implemented in the form of a single portable assembly that can be used on all platforms.

8. Explain about .NET Core Components.
The .NET Core Framework is composed of the following components:
- CLI Tools: Command Line Interface(CLI) tools is a cross-platform tool for developing, building, executing, restoring packages, and publishing. 
- Roslyn(.NET Compiler platform): It is a set of an open-source language compiler and also has code analysis API for the C# and Visual Basic (VB.NET) programming languages. Roslyn exposes modules for dynamic compilation to Common Intermediate Language(CLI), syntactic (lexical) and semantic code analysis, and also code emission.
- CoreFX: CoreFX is a set of framework libraries. It consists of the new BCL(Base Class Library) i.e. System.* things like System.Xml, System.Collections, etc.
- CoreCLR: A JIT(Just In Time) based CLR (Command Language Runtime). CoreCLR is the runtime implementation that runs on cross-platform and has the GC, RyuJIT, native interop, etc.

9. What is middleware in .NET core?
Middleware is software assembled into an application pipeline for request and response handling. We can use a middleware component for user authentication, for handling errors, and  for serving static files like JavaScript files, images, CSS files, etc.
These middleware components are built as part of the configure method’s application startup class. In the ASP.NET Core application, these Configure methods will set up a request processing pipeline. It contains a sequence of request delegates that are called one after another.
