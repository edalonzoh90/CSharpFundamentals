# SOLID principles



- ***Single Responsibility Principle (SRS)*** A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software’s specification should be able to affect the specification of the class
- ***Open/Closed Principle (OCP)*** Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. 
- ***Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)*** Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
- ***Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)*** Requires that classes only be able to perform behaviors that are useful to achieve its end functionality.
- ***Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)*** One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions
