# Object Oriented Programming Concepts

### Principles
- ***Abstraction*** Modeling the relevant attributes and interactions of entities as classes to define an abstract representation of a system.  
- ***Encapsulation*** Hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only allowing access through a public set of functions.  
- ***Inheritance*** Ability to create new abstractions based on existing abstractions.  
- ***Polymorphism*** Ability to implement inherited properties or methods in different ways across multiple abstractions.  

### Key Concepts
- Override  
- Sobrecarga   
- ReadOnly  
- Constructor chaining  
- Protected
